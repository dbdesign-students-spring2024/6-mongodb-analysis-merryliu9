I live on the second floor at 64 Granville Road with my daughter.  We enjoy sharing our "Cambridge tips" with all of our visitors: where to ice-skate in winter or rent a canoe in summer, the best local places for cheese, bread, and yummy ethnic take-out treats.  We can lend you bikes and direct you to the Minuteman Bikeway, an 11-mile shady ride through Arlington, Lexington and Bedford, or give you a couple of sleds and show you the hill at Fresh Pond.  Whatever the season, we look forward to welcoming you when you're in Cambridge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |within a day      |100%              |73%                 |t                |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/306681/profile_pic/1309790297/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small                               |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/306681/profile_pic/1309790297/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium                               |Cambridge            |2                  |3                        |['email', 'phone']              |t                   |t                     |Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States    |West Cambridge        |42.38258          |-71.13646         |Entire rental unit               |Entire home/apt|5           |         |1 bath          |2   |[]       |$225.00  |2             |1125          |2                     |2                     |1125                  |1125                  |2.0                   |1125.0                |                |t               |0              |0              |22             |284             |2023-12-27           |66               |16                   |0                     |2009-07-23  |2023-08-26 |4.8                 |4.95                  |4.97                     |4.89                 |4.9                        |4.92                  |4.73               |C0121120491           |f               |2                             |2                                          |0                                           |0                                          |0.38             |

I live on the second floor at 64 Granville Road with my daughter.  We enjoy sharing our "Cambridge tips" with all of our visitors: where to ice-skate in winter or rent a canoe in summer, the best local places for cheese, bread, and yummy ethnic take-out treats.  We can lend you bikes and direct you to the Minuteman Bikeway, an 11-mile shady ride through Arlington, Lexington and Bedford, or give you a couple of sleds and show you the hill at Fresh Pond.  Whatever the season, we look forward to welcoming you when you're in Cambridge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |within a day      |100%              |73%                 |t                |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/306681/profile_pic/1309790297/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small                               |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/306681/profile_pic/1309790297/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium                               |Cambridge            |2                  |3                        |['email', 'phone']              |t                   |t                     |Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States    |West Cambridge        |42.38227          |-71.13643         |Entire rental unit               |Entire home/apt|3           |         |1 bath          |1   |[]       |$225.00  |2             |730           |2                     |2                     |730                   |730                   |2.0                   |730.0                 |                |t               |0              |0              |0              |236             |2023-12-27           |42               |8                    |0                     |2011-05-24  |2023-06-30 |4.74                |4.8                   |4.93                     |4.83                 |4.93                       |4.95                  |4.78               |CO121110491           |f               |2                             |2                                          |0                                           |0                                          |0.27             |

As a young family we love the idea of living somewhere else and having the flexibility/comforts of a kitchen and yard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |within an hour    |100%              |99%                 |t                |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2212429/profile_pic/1423275652/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small                              |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2212429/profile_pic/1423275652/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium                              |Cambridge            |3                  |3                        |['email', 'phone', 'work_email']|t                   |t                     |Mid-Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States|Wellington-Harrington |42.37147          |-71.08939         |Entire rental unit               |Entire home/apt|7           |         |2 baths         |6   |[]       |$1,500.00|3             |28            |3                     |3                     |1125                  |1125                  |3.0                   |1125.0                |                |t               |0              |0              |0              |124             |2023-12-27           |75               |11                   |0                     |2012-06-29  |2023-08-17 |4.93                |4.89                  |4.91                     |4.96                 |4.99                       |4.8                   |4.76               |STR-17249             |t               |2                             |2                                          |0                                           |0                                          |0.54             |

We are a three-four minute walk to Davis Square and the subway in one direction, and also a two-three minute walk to the grocery store and bus on Mass Ave in the other direction.<br />Our location offers very easy access to Harvard, Tufts, Cambridge, Arlington and Boston. There are children's playgrounds within a short walk, and a public beach within a short drive. Davis Square, right at the next corner, is a destination in itself. <br />Here's a portion of an article from the Boston Globe about Davis Square:<br /><br />Somerville crossroads lives up to its hip image<br /><br />“We’ve come from a foreign land called suburbia,” a mother joked to her two highly energized toddlers as they darted about on the busy sidewalks of Davis Square.

I am currently indoctrinating my son to like these things so we can hit the road when he gets a wee bit older.  My last trip was across India by bicycle.  Good fun if you get the chance!  Since I've been in Cambridge, I've learned things that would be not possible while traveling, learning the guitar, making beer, perfecting my jerk chicken burritos...and I've grown to love this town...lively music scene, and the biking is getting better and better!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |a few days or more|40%               |74%                 |f                |https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/aba7335d-0836-43d7-9196-e58ec9464540.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small                         |https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/aba7335d-0836-43d7-9196-e58ec9464540.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium                         |Cambridge            |5                  |6                        |['email', 'phone']              |t                   |f                     |                                           |The Port              |42.36545          |-71.10268         |Entire rental unit               |Entire home/apt|3           |         |1 bath          |2   |[]       |$160.00  |30            |250           |20                    |30                    |250                   |250                   |29.0                  |250.0                 |                |t               |29             |39             |61             |151             |2023-12-27           |133              |3                    |0                     |2012-12-27  |2023-11-19 |4.57                |4.82                  |4.32                     |4.91                 |4.88                       |4.82                  |4.52               |                      |f               |2                             |2                                          |0                                           |0                                          |0.99             |

Though my children are grown, I love my neighborhood and appreciate the sense of community.  I know well the advantages of this location, and I always enjoy connecting people with historic and cultural resources. In keeping with these enthusiasms, I volunteer as a guide at deCordova Sculpture Park and Museum in Lincoln and participate in projects at a community art center near my house.  I post about art in the Boston area on a blog called ART OUTDOORS.   (Website hidden by Airbnb)   Currently a freelance writer and editor of educational materials, I keep a home office but still have one guest room that is not used often enough.  I think the room would prove to be a comfortable base for someone attending a conference or exploring the Boston area.  I am vaccinated and boosted and try to follow whatever masking, testing, and cleaning guidelines are current.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |within a few hours|100%              |89%                 |t                |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/4507945/profile_pic/1356651636/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small                              |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/4507945/profile_pic/1356651636/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium                              |Cambridge            |1                  |1                        |['email', 'phone']              |t                   |f                     |                                           |Agassiz               |42.38373          |-71.11424         |Private room in bed and breakfast|Private room   |2           |         |1 shared bath   |1   |[]       |$70.00   |3             |30            |3                     |3                     |30                    |30                    |3.0                   |30.0                  |                |t               |4              |10             |11             |39              |2023-12-26           |520              |36                   |2                     |2013-04-15  |2023-12-09 |4.93                |4.95                  |4.92                     |4.99                 |4.98                       |4.93                  |4.93               |                      |f               |1                             |0                                          |1                                           |0                                          |3.99             |

I grew up in historic Lexington Mass and studied Art History and Art Education. I make sculpture out of recycled computer parts out of a Maker Space called the Artisan's Asylum in Somerville and teach people of all ages. I put my heart and soul into renovating my condo and turned it into the dream home I always wanted! I love the back porch and back yard. It is the most relaxing place to hang out on a hot summer day! I rent to Harvard and MIT affiliates. Many international scholars have stayed in my condo.  Come visit MA.

Our place is relaxing and down to earth, with  an artistic and colorful ambiance, and lots of sunlight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |within an hour    |100%              |51%                 |t                |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/40965/profile_pic/1417297269/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small                                |https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/40965/profile_pic/1417297269/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium                                |Cambridge            |4                  |4                        |['email', 'phone']              |t                   |t                     |Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States    |North Cambridge       |42.39426          |-71.13258         |Entire condo                     |Entire home/apt|7           |         |2 baths         |3   |[]       |$450.00  |10            |30            |10                    |10                    |30                    |30                    |10.0                  |30.0                  |                |t               |23             |53             |83             |342             |2023-12-27           |0                |0                    |0                     |            |           |                    |                      |                         |                     |                           |                      |                   |C0169140491           |f               |3                             |1                                          |2                                           |0                                          |                 |

There are some columns that have no data or repetitive data points, which are meaningless for anlaysis, so I used excel to delete the columns.

# Analysis
## 1. show exactly two documents from the `listings` collection in any order
### description of query
This query retrieves the first two documents from the `listings` collection in the database. The `limit(2)` function limits the result set to the first two documents. This is useful for quickly checking the structure of the documents in the collection or for testing queries on a small subset of the data.
### code
```
db.listings.find().limit(2)
```
### results
```

We can lend you bikes and direct you to the Minuteman Bikeway, an 11-mile shady ride through Arlington, Lexington and Bedford, or give you a couple of sleds and show you the hill at Fresh Pond.  Whatever the season, we look forward to welcoming you when you're in Cambridge.`,

Additionally, the query shows various review scores reflecting guests' opinions on different aspects of their stay, along with amenities offered and pricing information. This data can assist guests in making informed decisions when choosing a place to stay based on factors such as host reputation, neighborhood characteristics, amenities, and overall value for money.

Many hosts have a long-standing presence on the platform, with some being designated as "superhosts," indicating a consistent record of exceptional hospitality. The listings cater to various budget levels, with prices ranging from $165 to $1,500 per night, and offer flexibility in terms of accommodation duration, as seen in the varying requirements for minimum and maximum nights. The majority of listings boast high review scores, suggesting that guests generally have positive experiences.

These insights provide a comprehensive overview of the accommodations available in the area, aiding both potential guests in making informed decisions and hosts in optimizing their listings.

## 3. choose two hosts who are superhosts & show all of the listings offered by both of the two hosts
### description of query
This query aggregates listings by hosts who are superhosts (indicated by `host_is_superhost: "t"`). It groups listings by `host_id` and pushes all listings for each host into an array called listings. The query then limits the result to the first two groups of `listings` (due to `$limit: 2`). It unwinds the `listings` array to separate each listing into its own document and projects specific fields for each listing, such as `host_name`, `host_is_superhost`, `name`, `price`, and `neighbourhood`. The result is a list of individual listings for the first two superhosts, with the specified fields.
### code
```
db.listings.aggregate([
  { $match: { host_is_superhost: "t" } },
  { $group: { _id: "$host_id", listings: { $push: "$$ROOT" } } },
  { $limit: 2 },
  { $unwind: "$listings" },
  { $project: { _id: 0, "host_name": "$listings.host_name", "host_is_superhost": "$listings.host_is_superhost", "name": "$listings.name", "price": "$listings.price", "neighbourhood": "$listings.neighbourhood" } }
])
```
### first three results
```
[
  {
    host_name: 'Candide',
    host_is_superhost: 't',
    name: 'Rental unit in Cambridge · ★4.88 · 1 bedroom · 1 bed · 1 shared bath',
    price: '$50.00',
    neighbourhood: 'Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States'
  },
  {
    host_name: 'Candide',
    host_is_superhost: 't',
    name: 'Rental unit in Cambridge · ★4.85 · 1 bedroom · 1 bed · 1 shared bath',
    price: '$51.00',
    neighbourhood: ''
  },
  {
    host_name: 'Candide',
    host_is_superhost: 't',
    name: 'Rental unit in Cambridge · ★4.88 · 1 bedroom · 1 bed · 1 shared bath',
    price: '$50.00',
    neighbourhood: 'Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States'
  },
  ...
]
```
### insights
The aggregation query results provide insights into listings hosted by superhosts on Airbnb. Notably, superhosts like "Candide" and "Jookun" manage multiple listings, indicating that managing several properties might contribute to achieving superhost status due to increased reviews and bookings. The listings exhibit a wide price range, with "Candide's" listings priced between $50-$51 and "Jookun's" at $159, suggesting that superhost status is attainable across various price points. The listings share similar characteristics, such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, hinting that consistency in quality and offerings might be crucial for maintaining superhost status. Additionally, all listings are in Cambridge, Massachusetts, implying that specializing in a specific geographic area and possessing local knowledge could be important factors for superhost success. However, incomplete details like missing neighborhood information in one of "Candide's" listings could impact guest decision-making. These insights underscore the significance of consistency, geographic specialization, and diverse pricing in achieving and sustaining superhost status on Airbnb.

## 4. find all the unique `host_name` values
### description of query
This query retrieves a list of distinct `host_name` values from the `listings` collection. The `distinct()` function ensures that each host name appears only once in the result, even if there are multiple listings with the same host name. This is useful for getting a unique list of all host names in the collection.
### code
```
db.listings.distinct("host_name")
```
### first three results
```
[
  '/We Are Kai & Nina', 'Aaron', 'Abe',
  ... 
]
```
### insights
Analyzing the distinct `host_name` values from the `listings` collection reveals a diverse array of hosts on the platform, ranging from individual hosts to professional hosting companies. The variety of names suggests a mix of cultural backgrounds and hosting styles, catering to different guest preferences. Some hosts manage multiple properties, indicating a strategy for maximizing earnings or leveraging real estate investments. Collaborative hosting is also apparent, with some listings managed by pairs or groups. Additionally, the use of unique or branded names by some hosts suggests a professional or business-oriented approach to hosting, aiming to establish a distinct identity on the platform.

## 5. find all of the places that have more than 2 `beds` in a neighborhood of your choice, ordered by `review_scores_rating` descending
### description of query
This query searches for listings in the "North Cambridge" neighborhood that have more than 2 beds, a non-empty `review_scores_rating`, and a non-empty `price`. The query filters listings to ensure that they meet all these criteria:

- `beds: { $gt: 2 }` ensures that the listing has more than 2 beds.
- `neighbourhood_cleansed: "North Cambridge"` specifies that the listing must be in the "North Cambridge" neighborhood.
- `review_scores_rating: { $exists: true, $ne: '' }` ensures that the review_scores_rating field exists and is not an empty string.
- `price: { $exists: true, $ne: '' }` ensures that the price field exists and is not an empty string.
The query projects only the `name`, `beds`, `review_scores_rating`, and `price` fields for each listing and excludes the `_id` field. The results are sorted in descending order by `review_scores_rating`, meaning the listings with the highest review scores are shown first. 
### code
```
db.listings.find(
  { beds: { $gt: 2 }, neighbourhood_cleansed: "North Cambridge" },
  { name: 1, beds: 1, review_scores_rating: 1, price: 1, _id: 0 }
).sort(
  { review_scores_rating: -1 }
)
```
### first three results
```
[
  {
    name: 'Home in Cambridge · ★5.0 · 4 bedrooms · 5 beds · 2 baths',
    beds: 5,
    price: '$729.00',
    review_scores_rating: 5
  },
  {
    name: 'Rental unit in Cambridge · ★5.0 · 5 bedrooms · 5 beds · 2 baths',
    beds: 5,
    price: '$224.00',
    review_scores_rating: 5
  },
  {
    name: 'Rental unit in Cambridge · ★5.0 · 3 bedrooms · 3 beds · 2 baths',
    beds: 3,
    price: '$175.00',
    review_scores_rating: 5
  },
  ...
]
```
### insights
Analyzing the query results and the query itself provides insights into the North Cambridge accommodation market that may not be immediately apparent. All three listings have a perfect review score rating of 5.0, indicating a high level of guest satisfaction for properties with more than two beds in this area. There is a significant price range between the listings, from $175 to $729 per night, suggesting a diversity of options from budget-friendly to luxury accommodations. Each listing has a matching number of bedrooms and beds, implying that these properties are designed to maximize sleeping space, catering to larger groups or families. This focus on larger groups is further emphasized by the query's specific filter for properties with more than two beds. Additionally, the consistent high review scores combined with ample living space suggest a high quality of life for guests staying in these properties. 

## 6. show the number of listings per host
### description of query
This query aggregates listings in the `listings` collection by `host_id` and `host_name`. For each unique combination of `host_id` and `host_name`, it counts the number of listings associated with that host. The result is a set of documents, each containing the host's ID and name, along with the count of listings they have. This query is useful for identifying hosts with multiple listings and analyzing the distribution of listings among hosts.
### code
```
db.listings.aggregate([
    { $group: { _id: { host_id: "$host_id", host_name: "$host_name" }, count: { $sum: 1 } } }
])
```
### first three results
```
[
  { _id: { host_id: 92029664, host_name: 'Robert' }, count: 3 },
  { _id: { host_id: 34194680, host_name: 'Tina' }, count: 3 },
  { _id: { host_id: 45011296, host_name: 'Lance' }, count: 24 },
  ...
]
```
### insights
The results provide insights into the distribution of listings among hosts. Some hosts, like 'Lance' and 'Kaan', manage a notably higher number of listings, with 24 and 30 listings respectively, indicating they might be professional hosts or property managers. In contrast, several hosts, such as 'Robert', 'Tina', and 'Nicole', have only 3 listings each, suggesting they could be individual hosts or small-scale operators. This variation in the count of listings per host reflects the diversity of hosting models on the platform, ranging from individual homeowners to professional hosting businesses. The presence of hosts with multiple listings also suggests that some individuals or entities are significantly invested in the Airbnb market, potentially leveraging it as a primary source of income or a business venture.

## 7. find the average `review_scores_rating` per neighborhood, and only show those that are `4` or above, sorted in descending order of rating
### description of query
This MongoDB aggregation query calculates the average review scores for listings in different neighborhoods. It then filters the results to include only neighborhoods with an average rating of 4 or higher and sorts the neighborhoods by average rating in descending order.
### code
```
db.listings.aggregate([
  review_scores_rating for each neighborhood
  { $group: { _id: "$neighbourhood", averageRating: { $avg: "$review_scores_rating" } } },
  { $match: { averageRating: { $gte: 4 } } },
  { $sort: { averageRating: -1 } }
])
```
### first three results
```
[
  {
    _id: 'Mid-Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States',
    averageRating: 4.93
  },
  { _id: 'Belmont, Massachusetts, United States', averageRating: 4.88 },
  {
    _id: 'Somerville, Massachusetts, United States',
    averageRating: 4.819999999999999
  },
  ...
]
```
### insights
These insights provide a snapshot of guest satisfaction across different neighborhoods, highlighting areas that consistently offer high-quality experiences. This information can be valuable for travelers looking for accommodations in Massachusetts and for hosts aiming to benchmark their listings against neighborhood averages.
